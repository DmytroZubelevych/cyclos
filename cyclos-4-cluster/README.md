# Cyclos Cluster Installation for High Availability of Online Banking Systems

[Cyclos](https://www.cyclos.org/) in Jelastic is a complete online banking system, that is packaged as an advanced highly reliable and auto-scalable cluster on the top of certified dockerized stack templates with the following topology:

- **NGINX** load balancer
- Scalable **Tomcat** application servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes
- **PostgreSQL** database cluster with primary-secondary (previously known as master-slave) replication to ensure high performance, fault tolerance and data security
